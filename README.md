## Contract Dependencies

# MyNft - ERC721 Token Contract

## Overview

`MyNft` is an ERC721 token contract implemented in Solidity. It inherits various features from OpenZeppelin's ERC721 implementation and its extensions, providing functionalities such as minting, pausing, burning, and voting.

## Contract Dependencies

- **ERC721:** The core ERC721 token implementation, handling basic NFT functionality.
- **ERC721Enumerable:** Extends ERC721 to provide enumeration capabilities, allowing for efficient querying of token IDs.
- **ERC721URIStorage:** Extends ERC721 to store and retrieve token URIs associated with each token ID.
- **ERC721Pausable:** Extends ERC721 to add pausable functionality, allowing the contract owner to pause certain operations.
- **Ownable:** Provides basic access control, allowing the contract owner to execute certain functions.
- **ERC721Burnable:** Extends ERC721 to add burning functionality, allowing token owners to destroy their tokens.
- **EIP712:** A utility library providing EIP-712 signature verification functionalities.
- **ERC721Votes:** Extends ERC721 to enable voting mechanisms on token-related proposals.

ERC721 and Extensions
ERC721: The core ERC721 contract provides basic functionalities for managing non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including ownership and transfer mechanisms.

ERC721Enumerable: This extension adds enumeration support, allowing efficient querying of token IDs.

ERC721URIStorage: Extends ERC721 to handle token URIs, providing a way to associate metadata with each token.

ERC721Pausable: This extension adds the ability to pause and unpause certain contract operations, giving the contract owner control over critical functions.

Access Control
Ownable: The Ownable contract ensures that only the owner (deployer) of the contract has certain privileges, such as pausing and administrative actions.
Token Burning
ERC721Burnable: This extension allows token owners to burn (destroy) their tokens, removing them from circulation.
Cryptographic Utilities
EIP712: EIP-712 is a standard for typed structured data hashing and signing. This library provides utilities for handling EIP-712 signatures.
Voting Mechanisms
ERC721Votes: Extends ERC721 to enable voting mechanisms for proposals related to token governance.
These dependencies make the MyNft contract a feature-rich ERC721 token, suitable for various NFT use cases with additional functionalities provided by OpenZeppelin libraries.


_nextTokenId: Private variable to keep track of the next token ID to be minted.
_mintedSuccessfully: Mapping to track addresses that have successfully minted tokens.
Constructor
Initializes the contract with the given initialOwner address and sets up ERC721, Ownable, and EIP712 configurations.
Pausing/Unpausing
pause(): Function to pause the contract, accessible only by the owner.
unpause(): Function to unpause the contract, accessible only by the owner.
Minting
safeMint(address to, string memory uri): Function to safely mint a new token for the specified address (to). It generates a new token ID, mints the token, sets its URI, and marks the address as successfully minted.
Checking Minting Status
hasMintedSuccessfully(address account): Function to check if a specific address has successfully minted a token.
getAllMintedSuccessfully(): Function to get an array of addresses that have successfully minted tokens.
Overrides
_update(), _increaseBalance(), tokenURI(), supportsInterface(): Functions required to be overridden due to the contract inheriting from various ERC721-related contracts.
This contract provides a comprehensive ERC721 implementation with additional features for pausing, burning, and tracking successful minting. It's designed to be flexible and compatible with various use cases in the NFT space.
